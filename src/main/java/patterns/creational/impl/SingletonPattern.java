/**
 * The singleton pattern is a type of creational pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object.
 * This allows the class to create an instance of the class the first time it is instantiated.
 * However, on the next try, the existing instance of the class is returned. No new instance is created.
 *
 * #USAGES -
 * The singleton pattern is mostly used in cases where you want a single object to coordinate actions across a system.
 * Singletons are mostly used by:
 *
 * Services: services can be singleton since they store the state, configuration, and provide access to resources.
 * Therefore, it makes sense to have a single instance of a service in an application.
 *
 * Databases: when it comes to database connections, databases such as MongoDB utilize the singleton pattern.
 *
 * Configurations: if there is an object with a specific configuration,
 * you donâ€™t need a new instance every time that configuration object is needed.
